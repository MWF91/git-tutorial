# git-tutorial

Hands-on tutorial for using Git. Companion slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AP4Vh3qEn643u_cwUG68FiwkYFovaTUA8NT2a9Xj8To/edit?usp=sharing).


# Tutorial Overview

## Get Git

Download the git core from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

On the same page is a link to a list of Git GUI clients. For beginners and people not familiar with the command line it can be helpful start out with a graphical client.

## Fork and Clone

Forking and cloning can be done from the GitHub page of the repository. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with the interface since many open source projects use GitHub. However there are many valid alternatives to GitHub like [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/trending) among others.

See https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/ for a more detailed guide.

## Branch and Contribute

There are many workflows for contributing code to a repository. The main ones involve creating a new branch for temporary work which is then regularly merged with the main branch that contains the stable/working version of the code. In GitHub this works via a 'pull request' that may be associated with a code review/approval step. Note that this is not a general Git operation but a common procedure in many user interfaces.
